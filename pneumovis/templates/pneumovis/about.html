  <h1>About This Visualization<br></h1><br>
  <p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria which causes respiratory
    diseases such as ear, nose, throat and lung infections. Data collected on specific strains of pneumococcus
    that are infecting young children in the first year of their lives. A
    certain vaccine, namely PCV-13, has been made in South Africa
    to attack specific strains of the pneumococcus however there is
    only a small number of strains being targeted. The purpose of this
    project is to implement an application which allows researchers to
    load new data, store data and visualize multidimensional data set.
    It is important to visualize data, especially large data sets, as it
    helps researchers to detect patterns, correlations and
    relationships within the data set, that may have not been easy to
    find when simply looking at the raw data. By the visualization of
    data and finding out which strains are on the rise, the PCV
    vaccine can be changed accordly.<br><br>
